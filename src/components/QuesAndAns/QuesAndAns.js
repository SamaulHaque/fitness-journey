      It’s a library. For building user interfaces. This is perfect because, more often than not, this is all we want. The best part about this description is that it highlights React’s simplicity. It’s not a mega framework. It’s not a full-stack solution that’s going to handle everything from the database to real-time updates over web socket connections. We don’t actually want most of these pre-packaged solutions, because in the end, they usually cause more problems than they solve. Facebook sure did listen to what we want.

        <b>State</b> <br />
        A state in React Component is its own local state, the state cannot be accessed and modified outside the component and can only be used inside the component which is very similar to, you already guessed it a function own local scope. We can define variables inside the function which can only be used inside the function block scope.
        <br /> <br />
        <b>Props</b> <br />
        Without props, React Component will stop making sense. A React component is a reusable component which can be used over and over again in the UI, but not always we are going to render the same component with same data. Sometimes we have to change the data or content inside a component.
